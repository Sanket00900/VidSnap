1
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,199
all okay okay guys we have with us Mr

2
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,080
Shan we'll take one question at time who

3
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,960
want to work first yes please

4
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,600
uh but I

5
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,280
think

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
25

7
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,220
[Laughter]

8
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,079
um Shan congrats uh you read the final

9
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,479
in your first World Cup uh tournament

10
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,320
you've done well of course you won the

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,840
junior World Cup as well uh um how does

12
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,759
it feel and also when they were chasing

13
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,439
they were doing fairly well at one part

14
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,720
of time limson and um Mitchell how did

15
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,600
you how did the team deal with that

16
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,640
honestly I think we knew it was going to

17
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,840
be challenging uh especially under the

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,280
lights on this once the new ball gets a

19
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,320
bit old it is a bit difficult for

20
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,360
bowlers here to you know contain run so

21
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,039
we knew it's going to be challenging but

22
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,759
what was important for us was to just

23
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,360
keep bowling the areas where we wanted

24
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,880
to ball and wait for them to make a

25
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,280
mistake and that's what we did and I

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,759
think darl land at one point darlan Kan

27
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,679
the partnership that they had it was

28
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,840
looking a bit challenging but with such

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,160
big scores you know you know couple of

30
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,640
fets here and there you're always in the

31
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,440
game your own your own um performance

32
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,280
reaching the final having won the junior

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,599
World Cup as feels great you know I'm in

34
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,720
the way our batting balling and fiing

35
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,239
the way we have dominated in this world

36
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,879
cup it's just as a player to be able to

37
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,959
play with all all those players uh

38
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,800
sitting in the dressing it's just been a

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,720
magnificent run for

40
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,920
us can you talk about M shab

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,990
[Music]

42
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
successful

43
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,840
[Music]

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,280
what kind of exchanges you have in the

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,680
middle uh honestly

46
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,640
because

47
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,150
[Music]

48
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,760
think single double single double

49
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,280
because I think we compliment our game

50
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,959
quite well so I think it works quite

51
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,280
well in the

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,560
middle

53
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,360
what about opening with Rohit you know

54
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,519
what have you learned from him and how I

55
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,720
mean is there something which really

56
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,840
impresses you about the partnership all

57
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,159
everything you know everything about him

58
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,000
really impresses me

59
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,600
[Music]

60
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,960
and here this team has conquered

61
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,720
everything they have won everything and

62
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,240
it seems like they're Invincible in this

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,919
world cup what is it that this makes

64
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,080
this team this apart from the skill set

65
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,280
whether it's the atmosphere is there

66
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,160
something that brings the together as a

67
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,919
group what is it from your point of view

68
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,000
I think one that we've been this this

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,199
team I think have been we've been

70
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,840
playing together for like the past one

71
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,199
year or so and I think we know our roles

72
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,560
quite well and I think the difference

73
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,440
that has been for me personally honestly

74
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,160
it's been our bowling attack the way our

75
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,639
bowling attack has bowled uh they have

76
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,039
in I think in all the matches they've

77
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,919
always uh either defended the total or

78
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,520
restricted the other team to a blow par

79
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,440
score so I think that's been the

80
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,000
difference Shan just extending that

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,479
question regarding your role when you're

82
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,199
opening with Rohit how difficult does it

83
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,199
get to kind of hold that Temptation back

84
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,400
because he's going all out from one end

85
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,080
so what is your role during that period

86
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,319
because we saw after he got out you kind

87
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,720
of started playing your shots more

88
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,840
freely so is that the plan that you know

89
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,680
as long as he there you'll be kind of

90
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,440
seeing it through and then go big after

91
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,360
he goes honestly when he was there I

92
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,240
didn't get that many balls

93
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,199
so after that I started to get no I mean

94
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,600
honestly my role is just you know play

95
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,240
my game in the power play uh look for

96
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,720
good shots look for good boundaries and

97
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,960
then once the power play is over because

98
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,600
I rotate the strike quite well then you

99
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,960
know rotate the uh rotate to the

100
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,800
Spinners and then once you are in then

101
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,680
it's all about you and your instinct how

102
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,759
you how you play how you you know see

103
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,919
which bowler to take on if the bowler is

104
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,280
under a bit of pressure then you know

105
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,639
when to take on it's all about reading

106
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,319
the game after

107
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,479
that shman I assume you grew up watching

108
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,960
verat play all the time and you battered

109
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,039
with him today on the day he scored his

110
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,000
50th Century I just wondered what that

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,400
was like for

112
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,000
you you know every time he comes on to

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,199
the park he does something special and

114
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,960
uh just how consistently he's been able

115
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,880
to do it for the past 10 15 years is

116
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,360
what is really uh

117
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,520
inspiring and I think it's for me it's

118
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,080
not so much about the skill that he has

119
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,960
but it's more about the hunger when he

120
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,560
goes there and the intensity at which he

121
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,560
plays the game is what inspires me and

122
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,720
to be able to have that consistently for

123
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,360
a for as long as he's he's been doing it

124
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,720
is what really inspires me can I just

125
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,599
ask your injury are you okay what

126
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,400
happened there it it started with cramps

127
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,560
and then uh I pulled my hamstring a

128
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,759
little bit and I think these are just

129
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,560
the it was quite humid and just the

130
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,360
after effects of for dingo you think

131
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,319
you'll be okay for Sunday yeah

132
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,520
definitely question shman you've got a

133
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,960
100% record in World Cup finals um with

134
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,000
the mount Mangan who we beenn in Tanga

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,199
um you're going back to your home ground

136
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,800
which is for the Gujarat Titans you're

137
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,639
playing in front of 130,000 people

138
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,599
potentially um this journey has been

139
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,840
fantastic over the last four years

140
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,319
you're the only one from that batch

141
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,199
which has kind of made that transition

142
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,120
into the team currently how does it all

143
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,479
feel how do you take it in and how do

144
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:49,240
you keep yourself

145
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,000
grounded honestly there are like lot of

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
things to look forward to right now we

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,319
have the finals after that we'd have

148
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,479
some other important series but uh those

149
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,159
are all in hindsight right now and if

150
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:03,759
you are always looking for something uh

151
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,080
to look forward to then it it it keeps

152
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,400
you grounded cuz there's something for

153
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,639
you to always work

154
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,520
on question shman you mentioned your

155
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,680
Deni just now and having recovered from

156
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,400
that uh physically like over all these

157
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,360
games that you've played like how

158
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,759
difficult has it been and has have you

159
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,879
had to like adjust something in how you

160
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,800
bat or anything about your game at all

161
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,319
not really I honestly not really

162
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,080
adjusted anything in terms of my batting

163
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,719
but because I've lost a bit of uh muscle

164
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,958
mass I think the reserve that I used to

165
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,279
have before the dingo has decreased a

166
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,399
little bit and that's why generally I

167
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,920
don't really get cramps when uh like you

168
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,399
do get cramps when you're playing in

169
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,399
humid conditions but that happens for me

170
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,880
it happens after a long period of time

171
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,800
not not uh so soon but because I think

172
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
I've lost a bit of muscle mass the

173
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,160
reserve has gone down a bit thank you

174
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,200
thank you
